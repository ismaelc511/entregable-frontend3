# TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT: 

The present project realizes a shopping cart for an e-commerce and has the following organization:

- :capital_abcd: node_modules: Is a directory that is created in the root folder of our project when we install packages or dependencies via npm.

- :capital_abcd: public: Public folder contains static files like index.html, javascript library files, images and other assets etc. which you don't want to be processed by webpack. The files in this folder are copied and pasted as they are directly in the build folder.

- :capital_abcd: src: It is the main folder of the application and will house 4 files:

1. **Cabecera.js:** It is a component that has no child components, no states, no methods, but has props that are inherited from APP.
2. **Item.js:** It is a component that has no child components, it has a number where the stock number defined by the parent is stored.
3. **Listado.js:** It is a parent component of Item, it does not need to handle a state, it has no methods, it receives the method to raise the state of the app and pass it to its child Item.
4. **Data.json:** Contains the information that is rendered on the page.
